GoEDataParser
=============

This is just a simple C# program to get into C# programming again. 

It allows to download chariging session data from Go-E cloud. Either via CSV file, or via JSON API. 

There is no connection from myself to Go-E, except I own a charger, so I have the possibility to use it's data.
